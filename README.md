# Handler-Object-Programming
HOP is a way to mix object-oriented programming and functional programming.
## How does it work?
In functional programming, we program (nearly) everything with functions!
In Object-oriented programming, we program (nearly) everything with objects!
In Handler Object Programming we program (nearly) everything with functions that take object parameters!
